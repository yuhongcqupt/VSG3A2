## Usage

- Python 3.9
- Numpy, pytorch, sklearn, random, math, matplotlib

## Describe

The repositories include five folders. Each folder corresponds to one of the experiments in this paper.

1. The folder  “train_model” provides the source codes of our VSG model, in which  the the "my_Model.py" file is the starter program and you will need to modify the internal code to achieve specific application effects.
1. The folder  “data” provides the source codes of our test model, specifically, this is a single hidden layer back propagation neural network.
1. The folder "data"  contains a number of data files, including experimental data and program logs.
